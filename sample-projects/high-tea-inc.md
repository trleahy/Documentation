**From** ***The Daily Bugle***

*Missing Entrepreneur Found Wanting*
The search for entrepreneur Tom Striven, missing for two days, has concluded. Police confirmed this morning that he has been found alive and well wandering around the South Base Camp of Mount Everest, in Nepal. The businessman apparently visited the site unexpectedly, amidst claims that his latest venture, High Tea Inc., was predicated on false information. He wanted to see it for himself, and flew to Nepal without informing his co-workers.

Confusion surrounds the new venture. Investors in the company apparently misinterpreted the location of the chain of fast-food restaurants, assuming "Nepal" was a typing error. The investment team were later surprised to learn that the venture was going ahead in the Himalayas, rather than the Southern-Italian metropolis they had assumed. Asked for a comment, Jim Black, head of the team, posed a question in return: "Who on Earth would be stupid enough to sell burgers on Everest?"

Tom Striven, throughout his career as an entrepreneur and executive manager, has taken the reigns at many aspiring startup companies. Though most ended in bankruptcy court, Tom has not been one to stay down for long. Colleagues know him as a go-getter who always picks himself up, and looks for the next opportunity.

The fate of his latest venture is uncertain. Colleagues expressed concern over Tom's well being, but also anxiety about their own positions in the company.

## Climate of Nepal
**Climate from [WeatherOnline](http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/climate/Nepal.htm)**

Nepal's climate is influenced by maritime and continental factors, and has four distinct seasons. Spring lasts from March to May, and is warm with rain showers, and temperatures around 22°C. Summer, from June to August, is the monsoon season when the hills turn lush and green. Temperatures can get quite warm, up to 30°C and more during heat waves. During this season, trekking in most of Nepal is difficult and uncomfortable, the trails being very muddy.

Autumn, from September to November, is cool with clear skies and is the most popular season for trekking. Temperatures are not too warm, with daily maxima about 25°C and cool nights with minima of 10°C, it usually does not rain for more that one or two days during the entire autumn and the winter season. In winter, from December to February, it is cold at night with temperatures sometimes below zero. However, the maximum temperatures can still reach up to 20°C. Then the mountains are covered with snow including some high hills.

## Yak Research
Did some research into Yaks, and whether you can eat them. Relates to discussion in [last meeting](#Meeting-on-Preparation-for-Nepal-Trip). #yak

**From [Moonlight in the Himalayas](https://moonlightinthehimalayas.wordpress.com/yaks-in-the-himalayas/)**

The Tibetan Plateau.

The Himalayas.

These are the landscapes that come to my mind when I think of yaks. They stand regally, in a manner that could be called Lordly, befitting their rank as the largest animal in the Asian steppe country. Somber is another word that comes to mind, suggestive of a robust grace: they belong to the bitter storms of the barren uplands of Tibet.

The yak is a valuable animal to the People that live here. Yaks supply transport, milk, protein, fur, hoof, dung, bone, skin, and tail. Tea is made with yak milk and is a staple part of the diet of yak herders. Milk is also added to mushrooms to make a milk-mushroom stew. They convert the sparse grass of this highland into clothing, butter for tea, fuel for the stove, and meat on the fire. Herding, in addition to small scale agriculture and trade with Tibet and lower foothills, enabled the Sherpa to live in this land of rock, ice and snow.

**From [Edible Alaska](http://ediblealaska.ediblecommunities.com/eat/yak-alaska-s-new-red-meat):**

Yak is “quite possibly the healthiest and best tasting meat on the market,” Bob says. On average, yak is 96 percent lean, is high-protein, high-iron and has a delicate beef-like flavor.

Me thinks the time has come for Yak burgers!

## Base Camp Research
**From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everest_Base_Camp):**

Everest Base Camp is either of two base camps on opposite sides of Mount Everest (It could also be any Everest base camp on given route, but this is less common since the two main routes became standardized). South Base Camp is in Nepal at an altitude of 5,364 metres (17,598 ft) (28°0′26″N 86°51′34″E), and North Base Camp is in Tibet at 5,150 metres (16,900 ft) (28°8′29″N 86°51′5″E). These camps are rudimentary campsites on Mount Everest that are used by mountain climbers during their ascent and descent. South Base Camp is used when climbing via the southeast ridge, while North Base Camp is used when climbing via the northeast ridge.

Supplies are shipped to the South Base Camp by Sherpas or porters, and with the help of animals, usually yaks. The North Base Camp has vehicle access (at least in the summer months). Climbers typically rest at base camp for several days for acclimatization to reduce the risks and severity of altitude sickness.

**Next Meeting**
- Better find out which of the two base camps we want to use. #followup
- Is it practical to ship a restaurant in on Sherpas? Better find out if there are other ways. #followup

## Team Members
Summary of the team's background, for the record.

**Tom**

Tom is probably the most experienced businessman in the group. Some would call him a ”serial entrepreneur”, others perhaps a “serial failure” — he hasn’t had a lot of “luck”.

The idea to sell fast food to high-altitude regions is his, and he arranged the initial investment. (The rest of us were not involved, and don't really know the details.)

**Janice**

Janice is an experienced business woman. Worked in Europe for many years before returning to join Tom on this venture. They worked together in the late 90s for a fast food chain, and figured now was the time to take it to the multitudes who don’t have ready access to a decent burger and fries.

**Christian**

The tech guy of the group is Christian. He is your average geek: beard, Google glass, zero social skills.  Good with computers though, and we are really going to need him if we are going to get Wi-Fi setup on Everest.

**Peta**

Peta is highly intelligent, but reserved and doesn't say much. She has a background working in charity organizations in developing countries. She is very fit, with a background in mountain climbing, making her perfect for the push into Nepal.

**Trevor**

That’s me. You know me already, but if I had to name a few points about myself, I would say that I am incredibly charming, highly motivated, and dashingly good looking. Only joking, of course — my charm is not “incredible” at all.
